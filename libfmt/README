NAME
    re::engine::Plan9 - Plan 9 regular expression engine

SYNOPSIS
        use re::engine::Plan9;

        if ("bewb" =~ /(.)(.)/) {
            print $1; # b
            print $2; # e
            print $'; # wb
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Replaces perl's regex engine in a given lexical scope with Plan 9
    regular expression provided by libregexp9. libregexp9 and the libfmt and
    libutf it depends on from Plan 9 are shipped with the module.

    The "/s" modifier causes "." to match a newline ("regcompnl") and the
    "/x" modifier allegedly causes all characters to be treated literally
    ("regcomplit"), see regexp9(3). The engine will "croak" if it's given
    other modifier.

    If an invalid pattern is supplied perl will die with an error from
    regerror(3).

CAVEATS
    The Plan 9 engine only supports 32 capture buffers, consequently match
    variables only go up to $31 ($& is number zero).
